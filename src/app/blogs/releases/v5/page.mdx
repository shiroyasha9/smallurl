# 🎉 Introducing Teensy v5: A Giant Leap for Link Management 🚀

Hello, awesome Teensy community!

Today, we're thrilled to unveil the brand new Teensy v5, a milestone that not only elevates your experience but transforms the way you shorten and manage URLs. We've worked meticulously to supercharge every aspect of Teensy, and we're buzzing with excitement to share the upgrades with you!

## 🔄 Seamless Query Params Integration:

Imagine sharing a customizable, short link that adapts to your needs on the fly. That's now a reality with Teensy's ability to pass on query parameters from your shortened URL to the destination URL. It's smooth, it's smart, and it's ready to use!

### Example at Your Fingertips:

Let's say you have a Teensy alias called **'ghsearch'** for GitHub search. You can now craft a link like this - `teensy.tech/ghsearch?q=shiroyasha9&type=users`, and voila! Your recipient will land exactly where they need to be, on `github.com/search?q=shiroyasha9&type=users`.

This feature works like a charm, even for protected Teensies, ensuring your convenience and security are never compromised.

## 🔥 Fully Server-Side Rendered Pages:

Bid farewell to waiting times and say hello to instantaneous loading! With the entire platform now server-side rendered, you'll zip through pages with performance so smooth, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

## ⚡️ Next.js 14 Powered:

We're harnessing the latest tech to give you the best. Teensy is now powered by Next.js 14, infusing our service with the bleeding-edge capabilities of the framework, making every interaction quicker and more reliable.

## 🎨 Unified Color Palette:

Dive into a sleeker, more cohesive visual experience with our standardized color scheme. This isn't just a facelift; it's about providing a professional atmosphere that's pleasing to the eyes and boosts your workflow.

## 🛠️ Shadcn UI Library Integration:

Every button click, form entry, and page transition is now more responsive and delightful, thanks to our shift to the Shadcn UI library. Expect a consistent and engaging user interface that makes managing your links a walk in the park.

And there's more under the hood:

- We've bid goodbye to magic links and streamlined authentication with Next Auth for enhanced security and simplicity.
- A shiny new component updates the global visit count as soon as it mounts, keeping you informed in real-time.
- Say hello to better organized files and folders, making Teensy more robust and easier to navigate for contributors.
- Environmental variables? Managed with t3-oss/env for better type safety and peace of mind.
- Our TRPC implementation is now cleaner and more tightly integrated, ensuring API calls are more efficient than ever.
- Visually, we've refined everything from the scrollbar to icons, aligning them with our new color palette for a consistent and intuitive UI.

But that's not all. We've sweated the small stuff, too:

- Transition flickers on initial mounts are now a thing of the past.
- The login page and modals are more stylish and user-friendly.
- Your analytics are now presented server-side for faster insights.
- A range of new components like dialogs and alerts from Shadcn enhances your interaction with the site.
- Our mobile navigation is now smoother and won't be overshadowed by the header.
- We've squashed bugs, improved layouts, and ensured that every click, tap, and swipe feels just right.

As you embark on this new journey with Teensy v5, remember that each feature has been crafted with your feedback and passion for efficiency. Your support is what drives us to keep pushing the envelope.
